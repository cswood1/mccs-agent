# MCCS Installation Assistant — Hackathon Project (NPS)

## What we're building
An AI chat assistant embedded on Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS) installation websites
(e.g. https://quantico.usmc-mccs.org/, Camp Pendleton, etc.).

- **UI:** an embeddable widget — a launcher button that opens a right-side pop-out panel with an
  "Ask me anything..." chat input. It must drop onto an existing site with a single `<script>` tag.
- **Knowledge:** everything on that installation's MCCS site — facilities, hours, locations, events,
  programs (fitness, child & youth, education, family readiness, MWR, dining, lodging, etc.).
- **Template + instance:** one shared agent "template" (behavior, tone, tools, guardrails), configured
  per installation (site URL, name, local context). Same code, different installation config.
- **Fresh data:** answers must reflect what's currently on the site (hours, events change often).
  Approach to be decided: crawl + index (RAG), live page fetch at question time, or a hybrid.

## Mental model from MCCS reps
Each MCCS site is like a college campus or a Disney park: many kinds of visitors with very different
needs, some things common across all installations, some unique to one base and its local area.

## Example queries (use as test cases)
- Simple: "Where are the gyms and what are their hours?"
- Complex: "I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for tuition assistance, and I need to get my
  Joint Services Transcript — can you help?" (multi-step, may point to resources beyond the site)

## Principles
- Cite sources: link to the MCCS page an answer came from.
- Don't invent hours, phone numbers, or eligibility rules — say when it's unsure and link the page.
- Mobile-friendly; most users will be on phones.

## Stack (proposed — confirm before building)
- Next.js (TypeScript) on Vercel; API route for the chat backend
- Claude API for the agent
- Embeddable widget script served from the same app

## Status
Environment set up; no application code yet.
